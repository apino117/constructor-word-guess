# constructor-word-guess

Welcome to the command-line version of word-guess, the second itteration of this idea and the less working of the two!

This game is for anyone who'd like to fix it. No but it's just a nice way to play hangman in the command line, sure and sweet.

The goal of this is to play hangman in node.

All of the content is pg-13 and immature at best.

To start do nothing because the whole thing is broken!

If you need any assistance that makes two of us!

Thanks!
